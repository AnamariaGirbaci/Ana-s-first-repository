Testing instagram

As part of the software testing course I chose to test the instagram application, because I use it daily and it is my favorite application.

I started from the Requirements Mindmap, then I drafted the Test Specification, I determined what I was going to test and I sketched the test cases in the testlink.

I discovered two bugs and an improvement, which are detailed in the Test Report.

For testing the application I used manual testing performing 33 test cases ( 2 failed ) and automated testing in Visual Studio Code using Cypress in JavaScript.

TESTING TIPES:

Smoke testing:E2E Testing

Exploratory testing: search bar;

Negative testing: login, search bar;

Security testing: password hidden;

Compability and cross-browser testing: desktop, mobile, different browsers: Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsof Edge;

API testing with Postman : login, view story, view photo, like photo, save post;

Regression and automated testing using Cypress with JavaScript;

TESTS RESULTS:

Functional : 25 tests- all passed

Non-functional : 9 tests - 2 failed, 1 defect found

CONCLUSIONS:

33 manual tests were executed (2 failed)

18 automated tests were executed (all passed)

14 API tests using Postman (all passed)

TOOLS USED:

Xmind – Mind map

MicrosofOffice– Test report, presentation

ScreenToGif – Video

Snipping Tool– Screenshots

TestLink-Test cases, Test execution

Postman- API Testing

Visual Studio Code – Automated testing

LESSONS LEARNED:

Be organized- create a mindmap

Start with Exploratory Testing

Write clear test cases

Not all tests can be automated
